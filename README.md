# Save Play Mode Changes in Unity

Unity tool allowing changes made in play mode to be restored upon returning to edit mode.

## Usage

EN : 
Add the `SavePlayModeObject` component to the root of any hierarchies you'd like saved. That's it!
  
KR :
플레이 모드에서 변화를 저장하고 싶은 경우, `SavePlayModeObject` 컴포넌트를 변화가 저장되어야되는 오브젝트에 추가해줍니다. 참 쉽죠!

## Method

Unlike other tools (such as PlayModePersist), this approximates the common trick of copy/pasting gameobjects from play mode to edit mode. 

We couldn't find a way to do this exactly as Unity does, so it serializes and deserializes gameobject hierarchies manually, mostly using UnityEngine.JSONUtility.

It's more of a hammer than a scalpel, but despite its drawbacks it can be a huge time saver so we're releasing it for anyone to use and improve.
**This tool is experimental. If something goes wrong, backups of your scenes are saved to a Backups folder on your desktop.**

### Advantages

The main reason for this is to:
- Save newly created or destroyed Unity objects (GameObjects and Components)
- Saves changes made to serialized fields
- Maintains object references _to_ objects inside or outside the hierarchies you're saving.

### Disadvantages

It's a brute force sort of solution. This means:
- You can't currently make exceptions to what's saved
- It'll break any references _from outside the_ list of things to save _into_ the list of things to save
- Makes lots of source control changes
- Breaks prefab connections
- Deselects and closes a previously selected and expanded hierarchy (not investigated)
- Can't save anything marked static, since static meshes are combined and don’t have asset files
- We've not found one in a while, but some components may not save properly

## How it works

The SavePlayModeChangesChecker class finds all references to `SavePlayModeObject` components on exiting the game. It serializes the entire hierarchy for those objects, and on entering play mode deletes the old hierarchies and creates the new ones.

## Other issues

- Undoing restored changes can break object references
- Small wait time when exiting play mode if something requires restoring
- Only scenes that are open in edit mode can be restored, and changing scenes in game will prevent the unloaded scenes being saved
